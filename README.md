## About Me

I am a second-semester Computer Programming student (T186) at George Brown College with a strong interest in AI engineering, web development, and automation. I bring hands-on experience from both industry jobs and technical certifications, and I enjoy building efficient, practical tools that solve real-world problems.

I’m currently working on projects involving automation, front-end development, and AI applications. I have a growing foundation in object-oriented programming, scripting, system design, and user-centered development.
